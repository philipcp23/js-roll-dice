GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they whish. 
    Each result gets added to their current score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all of their current score gets lost. 
    After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that the current score will be added to the total score. 
    After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on their total score wins the game.
